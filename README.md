Create an HTML file called ```index.html`` 

Add JavaScript inline (using <script> tags) that does the following:

* Defines a string variable called ```name``` and assign it your name

* Defines a numeric variable called ```age``` that contains your age

* Write the code to log ```My name is YOURNAME and I am YOURAGE``` in the developer console

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>JS Practice</title>
</head>
<body>
<script>
 var name = "Cierra";
 var age = 19;

console.log( "My name is " +name+ " and I am " + age);

</script>
</body>
</html>
